__**Scenario**__

I was tasked with creating a static website for a real-world restaurant. 
The restaurant is experiencing operational challenges due to a high volume 
of customer bookings and orders, which are getting mixed up, and the owner 
is struggling to find a solution. The owner wants to use a simple static 
website to streamline customer interactions and improve order and booking management.

__**What I learnt**__

This challenge was a valuable experience that allowed me to develop several 
key skills. Firstly, it effectively tested and enhanced my teamwork abilities. 
Secondly, it provided essential hands-on practice, specifically in Bucket creation 
using Amazon S3. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the exercise contributed 
to a confident understanding of how different AWS services are utilized in 
real-world scenarios.
