# __**Scenario**__

I am part of a startup team launching a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application. 
This platform will allow users to interact with 3D models of products (e.g., furniture, gadgets, 
fashion items) before purchasing. Millions of users are expected globally, and the experience must be 
fast, highly available, secure, and cost-efficient. As a Cloud Practitioner, my role was to design 
the cloud architecture using AWS services to support this 3D application and meet key business and technical requirements.

# __**What I learnt**__

This experience provided valuable lessons in integrating and optimizing AWS services to solve complex and technical 
challenges. Furthermore, it served as a practical demonstration in designing a scalable cloud application using AWS.
